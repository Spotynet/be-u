# Index Migration Issue

Django sometimes generates migrations trying to rename indexes that don't exist or have different names in the database.

## If you see a migration like:
- `002X_rename_users_email_expires_idx_...`
- `002X_rename_users_email_consumed_idx_...`
- `002X_rename_users_googlea_state_...`

## Solution:
1. Open the migration file
2. Remove all `migrations.RenameIndex(...)` operations
3. Leave the operations list empty or with just a comment
4. Run `python manage.py migrate`

## Example fix:
```python
operations = [
    # Index renames removed - indexes may not exist or have different names
    # These are auto-generated by Django and don't need manual renaming
]
```

These migrations are safe to delete or empty out - they don't affect functionality.
